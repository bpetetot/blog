Codelabs and workshops are a great way to learn new technologies or languages, but it's time-consuming to write and structure. They are very useful as documentation so if you don't want to read this post further, you can follow [the codelab](https://bpetetot.github.io/claat-image) ðŸ˜‰.

[Google has a great platform](https://codelabs.developers.google.com) providing guided tutorials about their products or technologies.

Thanks to their experience, they provide a suite of tools for authoring and serving codelabs.

### Write a codelab

There are two ways to write a codelab. Either directly in a Google Doc, where you can easily collaborate with multiple contributors, but you can't easily manage the source control. Either you can use a simple markdown file to write a complete codelab and push it in any git repository.

So first, you need to create a simple Markdown file, it will contain all the codelab content.

```markdown
id: id-of-the-codelab
summary: The codelab description
authors: Your name

# Here the main title of the codelab
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Step 1 heading here 
Duration: 1

### Here a sub heading
- How to foo.
- How to bar.

<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Step 2 heading here 
Duration: 5

Lot of features are available, you can:
- add code snippets
- use hyperlinks
- embed images
```
*A simple example of the Markdown syntax*

On the top of the file, some metadata describes the codelab (id, summary, category, authors, etc.). Markdown `heading` levels define the codelab structure and the different steps. You can find a [complete Codelab Formatting Guide](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/blob/master/FORMAT-GUIDE.md) explaining the codelab structure with Markdown.

Lot of features are available, you can use all the power of Markdown by adding code snippets, hyperlinks or images.

### Build a codelab

Google provides a CLI named [claat tool](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools/tree/master/claat) (Codelabs as a Thing). It generates HTML files from a Markdown file or a Google doc. But it needs some prerequisites: `Go` and `node` have to be installed on your computer. To avoid this annoying install process, I made a [light docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/bpetetot/claat) to use claat.

First pull the image:
```docker
docker pull bpetetot/claat
```

Then execute claat on your markdown file:
```docker
docker container run -it -v $(pwd):/app bpetetot/claat export my-codelab.md
```

Now you have a full HTML static codelab, you can deploy it with your favorite hosting provider.

When you are working on the codelab, you can serve it on localhost:
```docker
docker container run -it -p 9090:9090 -v $(pwd):/app bpetetot/claat serve -addr 0.0.0.0:9090 my-codelab.md
```

Now you can create amazing codelabs and documentation. ðŸŽ‰
