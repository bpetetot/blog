Here a few useful Javascript libraries I'm using in my web projects. Some are famous, some should be. None are framework oriented, you can use it with React, Angular, Vue, JQuery etc.

### lodash

Always useful, **[lodash](https://lodash.com)** is a set of utilities to handle strings, iterables, collections, functions. Don't reinvent the wheel, you will find what you need in lodash. 2 things to keep in mind when you use it in a webapp.

1. Don't forget to import only the module you need. You don't want to import all lodash utilities in your final bundle.
2. `lodash/fp` module will you give the ability to use it in a functional programming style.

```js
// import only the debounce function from lodash/fp
import debounce from 'lodash/fp/debounce'

const debounced = debounce(250)(search) // debounce the search function
```

### date-fns

Like lodash, **[date-fns](https://date-fns.org)** has a bunch of functions but dedicated to handle dates. This is a great alternative to [moment.js](https://momentjs.com) It uses the native Javascript `Date` object and you can import only the modules you need. Formatting, parsing, operations... most of date use cases can be done with date-fns.

```js
import formatRelative from 'date-fns/formatRelative'
import subDays from 'date-fns/subDays'

formatRelative(subDays(new Date(), 3), new Date())
//=> "last Friday at 7:26 p.m."
```

**[Day.js](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs)** is also a good alternative to moment.js. It is a minimalist lib (only 2KB) with almost the same complete API.

### validator.js

In web development, you always need to validate user's inputs. **[validator.js](https://github.com/validatorjs/validator.js)** contains all the validation functions you need: email, alpha, currency, credit cards, MAC address, etc. More than 60 validators! 

```js
import isEmail from 'validator/lib/isEmail'

isEmail('foo@bar.com') // true
```

### intl-messageformat

**[intl-messageformat](https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs/tree/master/packages/intl-messageformat)** provides a way to manage and format your app's string messages into localized strings. It uses the [ICU Message syntax](http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/messages) and works for all [CLDR languages](http://cldr.unicode.org) which have pluralization rules defined.

```js
import IntlMessageFormat from 'intl-messageformat';

const photos = `You have {numPhotos, plural,
    =0 {no photos.}
    =1 {one photo.}
    other {# photos.}
}`

const messages = new IntlMessageFormat(photos, 'en-US');

console.log(msg.format({numPhotos: 0}));    // => "You have no photos."
console.log(msg.format({numPhotos: 1}));    // => "You have one photo."
console.log(msg.format({numPhotos: 1000})); // => "You have 1,000 photos."
```

### DOMPurify

In some webapp, I needed to sanitize HTML string coming from the user or external sources. Most of libs I found were very heavy. [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) is one of the lowest and fastest sanitizer. Very easy to use, you can also override its default configuration.

```js
DOMPurify.sanitize('<img src=x onerror=alert(1)//>'); // becomes <img src="x">
DOMPurify.sanitize('<svg><g/onload=alert(2)//<p>'); // becomes <svg><g></g></svg>
DOMPurify.sanitize('<p>abc<iframe/\/src=jAva&Tab;script:alert(3)>def'); // becomes <p>abcdef</p>
DOMPurify.sanitize('<math><mi//xlink:href="data:x,<script>alert(4)</script>">'); // becomes <math><mi></mi></math>
DOMPurify.sanitize('<TABLE><tr><td>HELLO</tr></TABL>'); // becomes <table><tbody><tr><td>HELLO</td></tr></tbody></table>
```

### Feather icons

[Feather icons](https://feathericons.com) is just an awesome set of beautiful open source icons.

### Faker.js

You are tired to use lorem ipsum text or `foo`, `bar`, `baz` in your unit tests and mockups. So. You have to check **[faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js)**. It can generate addresses, company names, account numbers, phone numbers, images and so on. It supports multiple languages and locales. [Here a complete demo](https://rawgit.com/Marak/faker.js/master/examples/browser/index.html)

```js
import faker from 'faker'

faker.name.findName() // Rowan Nikolaus
faker.internet.email() // Kassandra.Haley@erich.biz
faker.helpers.createCard() // random contact card containing many properties
```


**And you. Which lib do you use in your web projects?**
